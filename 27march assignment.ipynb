    "Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it\n",
    "represent?\n",
    "answer:R-squared (RÂ²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a regression model. In other words, it quantifies the goodness of fit of the model. The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating that the model does not explain any variability in the dependent variable, and 1 indicating that the model perfectly explains all the variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating R-squared in the context of linear regression is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Sum of Squared Residuals}}{\\text{Total Sum of Squares}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the terms in the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR):** This is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the regression model. It represents the unexplained variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[ SSR = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where \\( n \\) is the number of observations, \\( y_i \\) is the observed value, and \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Total Sum of Squares (SST):** This is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable. It represents the total variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[ SST = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where \\( \\bar{y} \\) is the mean of the observed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared value is then calculated as \\( 1 - \\frac{SSR}{SST} \\). The interpretation of R-squared is as a percentage of variability explained. For example, an R-squared of 0.80 means that 80% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that R-squared should be interpreted with caution, and its interpretation can depend on the context. A high R-squared does not necessarily imply causation, and it does not provide information about the correctness of the model or the relevance of the independent variables. It is just a measure of how well the model fits the data. Additionally, R-squared may increase when more variables are added to the model, even if those variables are not truly predictive, so adjusted R-squared or other model evaluation metrics should also be considered."

    "Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared. \n",
    "answer:Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the regular R-squared that takes into account the number of predictors (independent variables) in the model. While R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained by the independent variables, adjusted R-squared penalizes the addition of irrelevant variables that do not contribute significantly to explaining the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for adjusted R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Adjusted R}^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - k - 1} \\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the terms in the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( R^2 \\): Regular R-squared.\n",
    "- \\( n \\): Number of observations.\n",
    "- \\( k \\): Number of independent variables (predictors) in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjustment in the formula involves taking into account the number of predictors and the number of observations. The key difference between adjusted R-squared and regular R-squared lies in the penalty applied for including additional predictors. The penalty increases as the number of predictors (k) increases, and it decreases as the sample size (n) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about adjusted R-squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Penalty for Adding Variables:** Adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of variables that do not improve the model significantly. If adding a variable does not contribute much to explaining the variability in the dependent variable, the adjusted R-squared may decrease or increase only slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comparison Across Models:** Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors. It provides a more reliable measure of the goodness of fit, especially in situations where models have a different number of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation:** Like regular R-squared, adjusted R-squared ranges from 0 to 1. A higher value indicates a better fit, and a lower value suggests that the model may not be providing a substantial improvement over a simpler model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, adjusted R-squared addresses some of the limitations of regular R-squared by adjusting for the number of predictors in the model. It helps in assessing the goodness of fit in a more conservative manner, considering the trade-off between model complexity and explanatory power."
