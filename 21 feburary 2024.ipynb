    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web Scraping** is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching and parsing HTML code from web pages to extract the desired information, which can then be stored or analyzed. Web scraping is used to gather data from various sources on the internet efficiently and automatically. Three areas where web scraping is commonly used to obtain data include:\n",
    "1. **E-commerce**: Scraping product details, prices, and reviews from e-commerce websites to analyze market trends and competitor pricing.\n",
    "2. **Research and Analysis**: Extracting data from news websites, social media platforms, or government websites for research purposes, sentiment analysis, or gathering statistics.\n",
    "3. **Real Estate**: Scraping property listings and prices from real estate websites for market analysis, investment decisions, or comparison purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web Scraping** can be performed using various methods, including:\n",
    "1. **Using Libraries**: Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium provide convenient tools for scraping web data.\n",
    "2. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**: Some websites offer APIs that allow developers to access data in a structured format without the need for scraping HTML. Using APIs is generally more reliable and efficient than scraping.\n",
    "3. **Custom Scripts**: Developers can write custom scripts using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Ruby to scrape data from websites directly.\n",
    "4. **Browser Extensions**: Browser extensions like Chrome's Web Scraper or Firefox's Data Miner provide point-and-click interfaces for scraping data from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beautiful Soup** is a Python library used for web scraping. It provides tools for parsing HTML and XML documents, navigating the parse tree, and extracting data. Beautiful Soup simplifies the process of web scraping by abstracting away the complexities of dealing with HTML code directly. It is widely used for its ease of use, flexibility, and robustness in handling imperfect or malformed HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python. It is commonly used for building web applications, APIs, and microservices. In a web scraping project, Flask may be used to create a web interface for displaying scraped data, providing a user-friendly way to access and interact with the extracted information. Additionally, Flask can be used to handle HTTP requests and responses, manage routing, and integrate with other libraries or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** provides a range of cloud computing services that can be used in web scraping projects. Here are some AWS services that might be utilized and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It can be used to host web scraping scripts or applications, allowing them to run on virtual servers in the AWS cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: S3 is a scalable object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data. It can be used to store scraped data, logs, or any other files generated during the web scraping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: RDS is a managed relational database service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It can be used to store structured data scraped from websites in a relational database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Amazon CloudWatch**: CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides real-time monitoring of AWS resources and applications. It can be used to monitor the performance of EC2 instances running web scraping scripts, set up alerts for specific events, and collect logs for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These AWS services can help in building scalable, reliable, and cost-effective web scraping solutions by providing computing resources, storage, monitoring, and management tools in the cloud."
