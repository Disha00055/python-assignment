    "Q1.who developed python programming language?\n",
    "ans:Python programming language was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s while he was working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in the Netherlands. Guido van Rossum is known as the \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" (BDFL) of the Python community, as he was the lead developer of Python for many years and played a significant role in shaping its design and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "ans:Python is a general-purpose programming language that supports various programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "Procedural programming\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "Functional programming\n",
    "Aspect-oriented programming\n",
    "Metaprogramming\n",
    "Python also supports several programming styles, such as imperative, declarative, and event-driven programming. Its flexibility and versatility make it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.Is python is case sensitive while dealing with identifiers.\n",
    "ans:Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, which means that it distinguishes between identifiers that differ only in their capitalization.It is essential to keep this in mind while writing Python code. If you use different capitalization for the same identifier, Python will treat them as two separate entities, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.what is correct extension of python file?\n",
    "ans:The correct extension for a Python source code file is .py.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Q6.Name few block of code use to define in python language.\n",
    "ans:In Python, a block of code is a section of code that is grouped together and executed as a unit. The blocks of code are defined using indentation. Here are a few examples of blocks of code in Python:\n",
    "conditional statement\n",
    "loop\n",
    "Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.state the character use to give single line comment in python.\n",
    "ans:In Python, the character used to give a single line comment is the hash symbol (#). Any text written after the hash symbol on the same line will be treated as a comment and will not be executed by the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.Mention function which can help us to find version of python that we are current working.\n",
    "ans:In Python, you can use the sys module to find out the version of Python that you are currently working with. The sys module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. To find the version of Python, you can use the sys.version attribute.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q12.what is maximum possible length of identifiers in python.\n",
    "ans:In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier is not specified. However, the Python style guide (PEP 8) recommends that identifiers should be no longer than 79 characters. This is a recommended guideline for readability and maintainability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. what are thee benefits of using python.\n",
    "ans:Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax that makes it an ideal language for beginners. It is also very readable and expressive, making it easy to write and understand code.\n",

    "ans:Memory management in Python is handled by the Python interpreter itself, using a combination of techniques, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference counting: Python keeps track of how many references each object has and frees the memory associated with an object when it has no more references. This is the primary memory management technique used in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collection: Python also has a garbage collector that periodically runs to find and free objects that are no longer referenced. The garbage collector is used to handle cyclic references, where objects reference each other in a loop and no external references exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory pooling: Python uses memory pooling to reduce the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation. Memory pooling involves reusing memory blocks instead of freeing and reallocating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's memory management system is designed to be efficient and automatic, so that developers don't need to worry about managing memory manually. This makes it easier to write Python code without the risk of memory leaks or other memory-related bugs. However, it's still important to be aware of memory usage in large or memory-intensive applications, and to use techniques such as profiling and optimization to ensure that code is running efficiently.\n",
