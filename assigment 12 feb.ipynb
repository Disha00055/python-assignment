    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "It seems like there might be an issue with the characters in your question, as some parts are not readable. However, based on the context, I believe you're asking about Exceptions in Python and the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception in Python:**\n",
    "An Exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are raised when an error or unexpected condition occurs that needs to be handled. They allow for graceful error handling and recovery in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "1. **Exceptions:**\n",
    "   - Exceptions occur during the runtime execution of a program.\n",
    "   - They can be caused by factors such as invalid input, file I/O errors, division by zero, and more.\n",
    "   - Exceptions are instances of classes that inherit from the `BaseException` class.\n",
    "   - They can be caught and handled using `try` and `except` blocks.\n",
    "   - Examples of common exceptions include `ValueError`, `TypeError`, and `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "   - Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase before a program is executed.\n",
    "   - They are caused by violations of the Python language syntax rules.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors prevent the program from running and need to be fixed before execution.\n",
    "   - Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, unmatched parentheses, and incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that can be caught and handled, while syntax errors are detected before program execution and require fixing before the program can run."

    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example\n",
    "answer:When an exception is not handled in a program, it leads to what is known as an \"unhandled exception.\" An unhandled exception occurs when an error occurs during program execution, but there is no code in place to catch and handle that specific type of exception. As a result, the program's normal execution is abruptly terminated, and an error message is displayed, providing information about the unhandled exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num  # This can potentially raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the program tries to get a number from the user and then calculates the result of dividing 10 by the entered number. If the user enters a valid number, everything works fine. However, if the user enters `0`, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur because you cannot divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the program runs into a `ZeroDivisionError` and there's no `except` block to handle it, the exception becomes unhandled. Here's what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program encounters the `ZeroDivisionError` during the division operation.\n",
    "2. Since there's no `except ZeroDivisionError:` block to catch and handle this exception, the program's normal execution is abruptly halted.\n",
    "3. An error message is displayed, indicating the type of exception (`ZeroDivisionError`) that occurred and a traceback of where the error occurred in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message might look something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the program terminates unexpectedly due to an unhandled exception. To prevent this, it's important to include appropriate `try` and `except` blocks to handle exceptions that could potentially occur during program execution. This allows the program to gracefully handle errors and continue executing, even if exceptions occur.\n"

    "Q3. Which Python statements are used to ,catch and handle exceptions? Explain with\n",
    "an example\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "In Python, the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements are used to handle exceptions. These statements provide a structured way to manage errors and control the flow of a program when exceptions occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how these statements work along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **try:** The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception. It's the part of the code where you anticipate that an exception might occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **except:** The `except` block is used to catch and handle exceptions that occur within the associated `try` block. You can specify the type of exception you want to catch, or you can catch a generic `Exception` to handle all types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **else:** The `else` block is optional and is executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. It's often used to define code that should run when no exceptions occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **finally:** The `finally` block is also optional and is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's used to define code that must be executed, such as cleanup operations, regardless of the exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example illustrating how these statements are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num  # This can potentially raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division result:\", result)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Execution completed.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Program continues...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `try` block attempts to get a number from the user and perform a division.\n",
    "- If the user enters an invalid value, a `ValueError` is caught and handled.\n",
    "- If the user enters `0`, a `ZeroDivisionError` is caught and handled.\n",
    "- If no exceptions occur, the `else` block prints the division result.\n",
    "- The `finally` block always prints \"Execution completed,\" indicating the end of the try-except block.\n",
    "- The program continues executing regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach to handling exceptions allows you to provide meaningful error messages, manage program flow, and perform necessary cleanup actions, enhancing the robustness and reliability of your code."

    "Certainly! The code constructs you mentioned are used in Python for exception handling. Exception handling is a way to gracefully manage and handle errors that might occur during the execution of a program. Let's go through each of them with an example:\n",
    "\n",

    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",

    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        print(\"Execution complete.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1: Division by a non-zero number\n",
    "divide(10, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block contains code that might raise an exception. The code inside the `try` block attempts to perform division. If the division operation succeeds without any errors (i.e., if `b` is not zero), the code inside the `else` block is executed. If an exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block (e.g., a `ZeroDivisionError` if `b` is zero), the code inside the `except` block is executed. Regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, the code inside the `finally` block is always executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 2: Division by zero\n",
    "divide(10, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, since the divisor `b` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be raised. This error will be caught by the `except` block, and the corresponding error message will be printed. The code inside the `else` block won't be executed in this case. However, the `finally` block will still be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's discuss the `raise` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "    elif age < 18:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Must be at least 18 years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    user_age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "    check_age(user_age)\n",
    "except ValueError as ve:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", ve)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Access granted. You're eligible.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Age verification complete.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `check_age` function is designed to validate the age entered by a user. If the age is negative or less than 18, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message. The `try` block in the main part of the code attempts to get the user's age and then calls the `check_age` function. If a `ValueError` is raised within the `check_age` function, it's caught by the `except` block, and the error message is displayed. If no exception occurs, the code inside the `else` block is executed. Finally, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, the code inside the `finally` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These constructs help you manage exceptions and ensure that your program handles errors gracefully while still performing necessary cleanup operations."

    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that allow you to create your own types of exceptions to handle specific situations in your code. While Python provides a variety of built-in exceptions (like `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc.), there are cases where you might want to create your own exceptions to make your code more understandable and maintainable. Custom exceptions help in raising and handling errors that are specific to your application's logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why you might need custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity and Readability**: By defining custom exceptions, you can give meaningful names to errors that are specific to your domain or application. This improves the readability of your code and helps other developers understand the nature of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: Custom exceptions allow you to encapsulate error handling logic in a separate part of your code. This enhances modularity and separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Debugging**: When an error occurs, a well-named custom exception provides more context about what went wrong, making debugging easier.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Withdrawal successful. New balance:\", new_balance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define three custom exceptions related to bank account operations: `InsufficientFundsError`, `NegativeAmountError`, and `BankAccountError`. Each custom exception inherits from the base class `BankAccountError`.\n",
