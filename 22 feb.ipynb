    "Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "In Pandas, a **DataFrame** is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). It can be thought of as a collection of Pandas Series objects where each Series represents a column, and the columns are aligned by a common index. DataFrames are one of the most commonly used data structures in Pandas and are suitable for handling structured data, such as data in CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or SQL tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Pandas Series**, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type. It is like a column in a DataFrame. A Series has a one-dimensional structure with an associated index, which can be thought of as row labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between a DataFrame and a Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a Pandas Series\n",
    "ser = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], name='MySeries')\n",

    "Pandas Series:\n",
    "0    1\n",
    "1    2\n",
    "2    3\n",
    "3    4\n",
    "Name: MySeries, dtype: int64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we created a Pandas Series named 'MySeries' with values 1, 2, 3, and 4. It's a one-dimensional structure with an index (0, 1, 2, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create a DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "data = {'Column1': [1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "        'Column2': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']}\n",

    "3        4       D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we created a Pandas DataFrame with two columns, 'Column1' and 'Column2'. It's a two-dimensional structure where 'Column1' is a Pandas Series containing numeric data, and 'Column2' is a Pandas Series containing string data. The DataFrame has an index (0, 1, 2, 3) for rows, and each column has its own label.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a Pandas Series is a one-dimensional data structure, whereas a Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure that can hold multiple columns, making it suitable for handling structured data with multiple attributes."

    "\n",
    "Pandas provides a wide range of functions to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Some common functions and methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection and Filtering**:\n",
    "   - `df['column_name']` or `df.column_name`: Select a single column.\n",
    "   - `df[['col1', 'col2']]`: Select multiple columns.\n",
    "   - `df.loc[row_index]` or `df.iloc[row_position]`: Select rows by label or integer position, respectively.\n",
    "   - `df[df['column'] > 5]`: Filter rows based on a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sorting**:\n",
    "   - `df.sort_values(by='column_name')`: Sort DataFrame by column.\n",
    "   - `df.sort_index()`: Sort by index.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Aggregation and Summary Statistics**:\n",
    "   - `df.groupby('column_name').mean()`: Compute mean by groups.\n",
    "   - `df['column_name'].sum()`: Calculate the sum of a column.\n",
    "   - `df.describe()`: Get summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - `df.dropna()`: Remove rows with missing values.\n",
    "   - `df.fillna(value)`: Fill missing values with a specified value.\n",
    "   - `df.drop(columns='column_name')`: Drop a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merging and Joining Data**:\n",
    "   - `pd.concat([df1, df2])`: Concatenate DataFrames.\n",
    "   - `pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key_column')`: Merge DataFrames based on a common column.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Transformation**:\n",
    "   - `df.apply(function)`: Apply a function to each element or row.\n",
    "   - `df.pivot(index='row_column', columns='column_column', values='value_column')`: Pivot the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - `df.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name'})`: Rename columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Visualization**:\n",
    "   - `df.plot(kind='plot_type')`: Create various plots, such as line, bar, or scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Export/Import**:\n",
    "   - `df.to_csv('filename.csv')`: Export DataFrame to a CSV file.\n",
    "   - `pd.read_csv('filename.csv')`: Import data from a CSV file.\n",

    "\n",
