    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "ans: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. Databases are used to store and manage vast amounts of structured data, and they are a fundamental component of many software applications and systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. They are based on the relational model of data, and data in these databases is organized into structured tables with predefined schemas. Some key characteristics of SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, which means the structure of the data (table names, column names, data types, relationships) is defined in advance. Any change to the schema requires altering the database structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Transactions: SQL databases typically support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce strict data integrity constraints, such as unique keys and foreign keys, to maintain data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are traditionally scaled vertically by adding more resources to a single server. While horizontal scaling is possible, it can be more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases encompass various database types that do not rely on a fixed schema and do not use SQL as their primary query language. They are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data with more flexibility. Some key characteristics of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema Flexibility: NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility, allowing developers to store and retrieve data without a predefined schema. This is particularly useful for handling large volumes of dynamic or changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed with horizontal scalability in mind. They can distribute data across multiple servers, making them suitable for handling massive workloads and Big Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variety of Data Models: NoSQL databases come in various data models, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases, each optimized for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventual Consistency: Some NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency, leading to an \"eventual consistency\" model in distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (column-family), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in their data models and querying languages. SQL databases are structured and rely on a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases offer more flexibility and support various data models. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements and use cases of a project."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "ans:  DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure or schema of a database. DDL statements are responsible for defining database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints, as well as altering or deleting them. Here's an explanation of some common DDL statements and their usage with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE:** The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:** Creating a table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee information.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       Department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP:** The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:** Deleting the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER:** The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:** Adding a new column \"Email\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ADD Email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE:** The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact. It is faster than DELETE for removing all data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:** Removing all data from the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE** is used to define new database objects.\n",
    "- **DROP** is used to remove database objects.\n",
    "- **ALTER** is used to modify the structure of existing database objects.\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE** is used to remove all data from a table while preserving its structure.\n",

DML statements are responsible for adding, modifying, and deleting data records within database tables. Here, we'll explain three common DML statements: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INSERT:** The INSERT statement is used to add new records (rows) into a database table.\n",

    "Q4: What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve or query data from a database. DQL statements are primarily focused on selecting and retrieving data from one or more database tables. The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT. Here, we'll explain the SELECT statement with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT Statement:**\n",
    "The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, apply filters, and sort the results. The basic syntax of a SELECT statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `column1, column2, ...`: The columns you want to retrieve. You can use `*` to select all columns.\n",
    "- `table_name`: The name of the table from which you want to retrieve data.\n",
    "- `condition`: Optional. Specifies conditions that must be met for the rows to be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Let's say we have a table named \"Employees\" with columns: `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Department`, and we want to retrieve the names of all employees in the \"HR\" department.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT FirstName, LastName\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Department = 'HR';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are using the SELECT statement to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify that we want to retrieve the `FirstName` and `LastName` columns.\n",
    "- Specify that we are retrieving data from the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "- Use the WHERE clause to filter the results to only include rows where the `Department` is 'HR'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this query will be a list of first names and last names of employees who work in the \"HR\" department.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT statements can also include various clauses to control the ordering of results (`ORDER BY`), limit the number of rows returned (`LIMIT` or `TOP`), join multiple tables together (`JOIN`), and perform aggregate calculations (`GROUP BY` and aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.). DQL is essential for retrieving specific data from databases, and it's a fundamental component of most database-driven applications."

    "Q5: Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Primary Key** is a database constraint that uniquely identifies each record or row in a database table. It serves as a reference point for establishing relationships between different tables and ensures the integrity and uniqueness of data within a table. Here are some key characteristics and points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniqueness:** Every value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across all rows in the table. This uniqueness ensures that no two records in the table have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-null:** A primary key column(s) cannot contain null values. Each record must have a valid value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single or Composite:** A primary key can consist of a single column or a combination of multiple columns. In the latter case, it's called a composite primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indexed:** Primary key columns are often automatically indexed by the database management system (DBMS) for faster retrieval of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Used for Referential Integrity:** Primary keys are used to establish relationships between tables, specifically with foreign keys. They ensure that data in related tables remains consistent and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Foreign Key** is a database constraint that establishes a link or relationship between two tables. It typically consists of one or more columns in one table that reference the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, ensuring that data in related tables remains consistent. Here are some key characteristics and points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **References a Primary Key:** A foreign key column(s) in one table references the primary key column(s) of another table, creating a relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enforces Referential Integrity:** Foreign keys enforce referential integrity rules, preventing actions that would lead to inconsistent data, such as deleting a record that is referenced by foreign keys in other tables (CASCADE or SET NULL actions can be specified).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Can Be Null:** While foreign keys often contain values that match primary keys, they can also contain null values. A null foreign key typically indicates an optional or non-existent relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Used for Joins:** Foreign keys are used to join related tables to retrieve data that spans multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Improves Data Integrity:** By enforcing relationships and ensuring that data remains consistent across tables, foreign keys improve data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders.\" The \"Customers\" table has a primary key column called \"CustomerID,\" which is unique for each customer. The \"Orders\" table has a foreign key column called \"CustomerID\" that references the \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables, allowing you to associate orders with specific customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies records within a table, while a foreign key establishes relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient data retrieval through joins. Both primary and foreign keys play a crucial role in database design and maintaining data consistency."

    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of `cursor()` and `execute()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`cursor()` Method:**\n",
    "   - The `cursor()` method is used to create a cursor object associated with the database connection. A cursor allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.\n",
    "   - Cursors are used to manage the state of your interactions with the database, including executing SQL statements and fetching results.\n",
    "   - In the example, `cursor = connection.cursor()` creates a cursor object named `cursor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`execute()` Method:**\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries or statements using the cursor. You pass the SQL query as an argument to this method.\n",
    "   - After calling `execute()`, the cursor becomes \"active,\" and you can work with the results (if any) of the query.\n",
    "   - In the example, `cursor.execute(query)` executes the SQL query stored in the `query` variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   After executing the query, you can fetch the results using methods like `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, or iterate through the results as shown in the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Closing the Cursor and Connection:**\n",
    "   - It's important to close the cursor and connection when you're done using them to free up resources and release the database connection.\n",
    "   - In the example, `cursor.close()` and `connection.close()` are used to close the cursor and the connection, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code establishes a connection to your MySQL database, executes a SELECT query using the cursor, and then prints the retrieved rows. It's a basic example, and you can expand on it to perform various database operations."

    "ans:\n",
    "In an SQL query, the order of execution of SQL clauses is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM:** The `FROM` clause specifies the source table(s) from which you want to retrieve data. It identifies the table(s) you are querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WHERE:** The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the rows from the source table(s) based on a specified condition. It restricts the rows returned by the query to those that meet the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY:** The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows from the source table(s) into sets based on the values in one or more columns. This is often used in combination with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc., to perform calculations on groups of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HAVING:** The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to filter groups of rows based on aggregate function results. It acts as a filter for groups, similar to how the `WHERE` clause filters individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SELECT:** The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns you want to include in the result set. It determines which columns from the source table(s) are retrieved and displayed in the query result.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DISTINCT:** The `DISTINCT` keyword is used in the `SELECT` clause to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set, ensuring that each row is unique based on the selected columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY:** The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It specifies the sorting order (ascending or descending) for each column used for sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LIMIT/OFFSET (optional):** The `LIMIT` clause is used to limit the number of rows returned in the result set, while the `OFFSET` clause is used to skip a specified number of rows. These clauses are often used for pagination or limiting query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query. The specific clauses used in a query depend on the query's purpose and the data you want to retrieve or manipulate. Additionally, some database systems may have additional or specialized clauses that can be used in specific situations."
