    "**Q1: What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios is it preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**MongoDB:**\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. It is known for its flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents. These documents are organized into collections, which are similar to tables in SQL databases. MongoDB is often used for applications where flexibility, horizontal scalability, and quick development are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):**\n",
    "Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a category of database management systems that do not rely on the traditional tabular, relational data model used by SQL databases. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases, to store and manage data. They are designed to handle large volumes of data with varying structures and are known for their scalability, high performance, and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios to Prefer MongoDB over SQL Databases:**\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in certain scenarios due to its unique features and advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schema Flexibility:** MongoDB allows you to store data with varying structures within the same collection. This flexibility is valuable when dealing with semi-structured or rapidly changing data, which may not fit well into a fixed SQL schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Horizontal Scalability:** MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, making it suitable for applications with high volumes of data and high traffic. It can distribute data across multiple servers easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document-Oriented:** MongoDB's document-oriented data model is well-suited for applications that work with complex, hierarchical, or nested data structures, as it allows you to store related data together in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quick Prototyping and Agile Development:** MongoDB's flexibility and lack of rigid schema make it conducive to rapid application development and prototyping. Developers can adapt the data model as requirements evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Big Data and Real-time Analytics:** MongoDB is used in scenarios involving big data, real-time data processing, and analytics, where data is constantly changing and being ingested.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Content Management Systems (CMS):** MongoDB is commonly used in content management systems and applications that handle a wide variety of content types, such as articles, images, videos, and user-generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **IoT (Internet of Things):** MongoDB is suitable for IoT applications that collect and store large amounts of sensor data from various devices and sensors, as it can handle the semi-structured nature of IoT data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Use Cases Requiring High Write Throughput:** MongoDB excels in scenarios that require high write throughput, such as logging and event data capture, where traditional SQL databases may struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice between MongoDB and SQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application. While MongoDB offers advantages in flexibility and scalability, SQL databases excel in situations that require complex transactions, strict data consistency, and well-defined schemas. The decision should be based on your application's data modeling needs, scalability requirements, and overall project goals."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "ans: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Below are some of the key features of MongoDB, along with explanations for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document-Oriented:** MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents. These documents can have varying structures and can represent complex, hierarchical data. This flexibility makes it easier to work with data that doesn't fit neatly into tables and rows, as in traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schemaless:** MongoDB is schemaless, meaning it doesn't enforce a fixed structure for data. You can change the structure of documents in a collection on the fly, without affecting other documents. This makes it well-suited for applications where data schemas evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Queries:** MongoDB supports dynamic queries and indexing, allowing you to perform complex queries on your data. You can query based on fields within documents, and MongoDB provides a rich set of query operators for precise data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Highly Scalable:** MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability. It can distribute data across multiple servers or nodes, making it suitable for applications with growing data and traffic demands. You can scale out by adding more servers to a MongoDB cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Replication:** MongoDB supports data replication, providing data redundancy and high availability. It allows you to create replica sets, where one primary node handles writes, and one or more secondary nodes replicate data. If the primary node fails, a secondary node can be promoted to primary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Automatic Sharding:** Sharding is a technique for distributing data across multiple servers. MongoDB offers automatic sharding, which helps distribute data efficiently across shards (partitions) and balances the load, ensuring even data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Ad Hoc Queries:** MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, allowing you to query your data without the need for predefined schema or indexes. This flexibility is useful for exploratory data analysis and quick prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Geospatial Queries:** MongoDB provides geospatial indexing and querying capabilities, making it suitable for location-based applications that require location-aware queries, such as finding nearby points of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Aggregation Framework:** MongoDB offers a powerful aggregation framework for performing complex data transformations and calculations on the database server side. This is particularly useful for analytics and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **GridFS:** MongoDB includes GridFS, a specification for storing large files (e.g., images, videos) in the database. It breaks large files into smaller chunks, making it easier to store and retrieve large media files.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Security:** MongoDB offers various security features, including authentication, authorization, SSL/TLS encryption, auditing, and role-based access control (RBAC), to protect data and ensure secure access.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Community and Enterprise Editions:** MongoDB is available in both a free and open-source Community Edition and a paid Enterprise Edition that includes additional features, support, and advanced security options.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Robust Ecosystem:** MongoDB has a rich ecosystem of tools, drivers, libraries, and integrations that support various programming languages and frameworks, making it accessible and usable across a wide range of application development scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make MongoDB a versatile and popular choice for applications that require flexibility, scalability, and the ability to work with diverse and evolving data structures. However, it's essential to carefully consider your project's requirements and data modeling needs to determine whether MongoDB is the right fit for your specific use case."

    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "ans:To connect MongoDB to Python, you can use the `pymongo` library, which is the official Python driver for MongoDB. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to connect to MongoDB, create a database, and create a collection in MongoDB using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install pymongo:**\n",
    "   If you haven't already installed the `pymongo` library, you can do so using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install pymongo\n",
